The goal for this lab is to be able to utilize the LEDs on the board. The main objective is checking whether a 5-bit number is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, or 5. Each number multiple should be assigned to a different LED and then another LED should be assigned to whether the number is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5. We need to write Verilog code for this design, along with editing the constraints file to program the LEDs and the correct switches. A test bench must also be created in order to demonstrate the different LEDs and the different binary numbers. A ReadMe file must also be created.
